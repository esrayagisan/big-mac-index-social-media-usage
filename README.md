# Relationship Between Big Mac Index and Social Media Usage

## Project Summary
This project aims to examine the relationship between the **Big Mac Index**, which reflects a country's economic well-being, and its **social media usage rate**.  
The goal is to analyze whether countries with stronger economies tend to have higher social media usage rates using data science methods.

## Motivation
Social media is one of the most influential tools for communication and information sharing in modern societies. However, the intensity of its use may vary across countries depending on their economic conditions.  
This project explores whether there is a significant relationship between an economic indicator (the Big Mac Index) and the proportion of people actively using social media.  
The findings will help understand how economic prosperity influences digital behaviors.

## Research Question
> “Is there a relationship between a country's Big Mac Index value and its social media usage rate?”

## Data Sources
1. **Big Mac Index (The Economist)**  
   - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/the-economists-big-mac-index
   - Content: 2025 Country-level Big Mac prices (local currency and USD), purchasing power parity (PPP) values.
2. **Social Media Usage Rate**  
   - Sources: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/social-media-users-by-country
   - Content: Percentage of the population having a social media account by country.

Both datasets will be merged using country names as the common key.

## Expected Results
- It is expected that economically stronger countries tend to have higher social media usage rates.  
- However, some middle-income countries may also show high social media penetration.  
- The results may reveal that digital engagement is not solely determined by economic wealth.
